# Dotfiles

Hello! And welcome! 

These are my _dotfiles_, a way of storing Linux system configuration in version control! Ideally, this will make keeping a consistent setup across multiple machines much easier, in practice its not perfect but certainly alleviating some headaches!

I currently have two sets of dotfiles but only keep one up to date for my Arch setup (btw). I did dabble with NixOS but it is no longer being maintained

### [NixOS](https://github.com/BenjaminPalko/dotfiles/tree/nixos)
